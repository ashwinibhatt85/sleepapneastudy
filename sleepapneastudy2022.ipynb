Section 1. Business Understanding
For this project on writing a data science blog post, I have chosen a dataset on Sleep Apnea from VA Medical Center - Detroit. This dataset has Sleep Apnea Architecture and metrics along with other info about the patients. To help better understand the data I have the following questions.

Questions

1)	What are the Preventable factors and their impacts over the Sleep Apnea
2)	What are non-Preventable factors and their impacts over sleep apnea
3)	Can it be cured/ or even controlled over time? If Yes, How?

# Import libraries needed
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
