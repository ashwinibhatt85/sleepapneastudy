# Sleep Apnea Study Analysis
This is a repo created for exploratory study on Sleep Apnea.

## Installations
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivation

For past 5+ years, I have had numerous conversations on this topic with my 'true partner' and her colleagues, over countless coffees, numerous dinners and so much more. Using a set of raw data from the study conducted in the Sleep Research Lab at VA Medical Centre in Detroit, I am trying to answer the following questions by doing an exploratory data analysis on the subject.

- Does being of a specific race predisposes you to have sleep apnea?
- How does oneâ€™s lifestyle affects sleep apnea? Activity, health, exercise, stress
- What factors are major influencers of sleep apnea? Ahi, bmi, age, race, gender, bp, sugar, diet, smoking/drinking, presence of gene, socio economic status 
- Can it be cured/controlled over time? How?

## File Descriptions
- A jupyter notebook with markdown cells and comments added throughout to explain the process taken to gather, asses, clean, transform and analyze the sleep apnea data.
- A csv file that contains the sleep apnea study data of 50 patients along with their sleep architecture & apnea metrics, demographics, BMI and lifestyle suggesting details.
